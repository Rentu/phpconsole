# Missing VCRUNTIME140.dll fixing
<img src="https://ugetfix.com/wp-content/uploads/articles/askit/vcruntime140-dll-is-missing-error-windows_en.jpg"/>
We have noticed that PHP Console failed to load because there was a missing .dll file from some user's PC. Here is a guide to help you out.

### Recommendations
We recommend reinstalling the Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 to fix the missing VCRUNTIME140.dll error. It is important to follow official Microsoft guidelines and install the missing files properly, otherwise, you will have to struggle with each corrupted program separately, which you clearly do not want to happen.

### Download .dll File
There are two files available to download for 32-bits and 64-bits.
<p><a href="https://download.microsoft.com/download/0/6/4/064F84EA-D1DB-4EAA-9A5C-CC2F0FF6A638/vc_redist.x64.exe">vc_redist.x64.exe(64-bits) - <b>14.3MB</b></p>
<p><a href="https://download.microsoft.com/download/0/6/4/064F84EA-D1DB-4EAA-9A5C-CC2F0FF6A638/vc_redist.x86.exe">vc_redist.x86.exe(32-bits) - <b>13.5MB</b></p>
